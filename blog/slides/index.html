                Simplest way to switch to the slides menu is by pressing F9. Pressing F9 will toggle between the slide and edit menu.
                There are also buttons to switch: to slidesin the "slides menu".
                You can go back to the edit menu by pressing the to edit  in the "slides options </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Adding slides is pretty easy. First, open the slides controls, and then press "add". This will change the cursor
                    to a cross.
                    Then drag a rectangular area over the map: a blueish rectangle area should now appear: we will name this a slider.
                    Position and resize the slider over the area you want to show on the slide.
                    Then press "make". The slider will now disappears and a slide preview should appear in the slides
                    menu on the left.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is also a hotkey to make a slide: click and hold control then press shift.
                    The slider also has a contextmenu, from which you can access the same controls as in
                    the "slides control". The context menu can be accessed by right clicking the slider.

        <h1>Starting a slideshow</h1>
        <p class=intro>
            When you start a slideshow, Breakdown Notes will zoom
            into each slide as much is possible, at your command. The controls to start a slideshow, you will find in the "start presentation" menu.
            There are some options you can choose. Here's how and why you want to use these.

        </p>

        <div>

            <div>
                <h3>Starting, stopping and moving between slides</h3>
                <p>
                    To start a slideshow simply press start and to end a slideshow
                    press stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To move between slides, you simply press the next
                    or the button labeled prev. You can also use the arrow right and left keys on your keyboard.
                    <br>
                    If you choose to hide the menu, (press F10 or the triangle button), in the bottom right side of the screen
                    a buttons will appear to move forward, backward or stop the slide show.
                </p>
            </div>



            <h3>Filters</h3>
            <div class=grid_duo>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The slides you make can have any dimension: you can make them as long or wide as you please.
                        When you show a slide only the width or the height of your display/screen and slide will match.
                        In the non-matching dimension a part of the map that is not on the slide might be shown. And on that part of the map
                        there may be shapes. With filters you control what happens with these shapes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a filter is set to hide, these shape will be hidden when you zoom to a slide.  If the filter is set to fade,
                        the shapes not on the slide will be faded, so you can still see a bit of the layout, but it is clear that these shapes
                        don't belong on the current slide. And lastly, you can set the filter to none: now all the shapes will be displayed.

                    </p>

        <h1>Adding or removing shapes from slides</h1>
        <p>
            Sometimes you made a slide but do not want everything inside it to be displayed on that slide.
            You can exclude this slides with a few button clicks.
        </p>


        <div>
            <h3>Removing shapes from slides</h3>
            <div class=grid_duo>
                <p>
                    You can remove shapes from slides in the following way. First click the slide preview from which
                    you want to remove slides. Then press "exclude slides".
                    You now have entered the slide exclusion mode: any shapes highlighted in green will be displayed on the slide.
                    Slides highlighted in red, will not be displayed.
                    You can toggle between red and green by simply clicking the shape.
                    When you're done, click the done button on the top left position of the screen.

        <h3>Repositioning a slide</h3>

            <div >
                <p>
                    You might want to reposition a slide after you made one. The way to do this is by
                    right clicking the corresponding slide preview. A menu with options will pop up from where you can show
                    the slider. If you click it, the slider will re-appear on the map.
                    Now you can reposition and resize the slider, and when you are done, press "update".

                </p><p>
                    There is also a button labelled "wrap".
                    Press this, and the slide will be wrapped tightly around the shapes.
                </p>

                    Just drag the slide preview up or down, after the slide preview you want to have it displayed after.
                    To delete a slide, simply press "remove slide" from the slide controls.

        <h1>What happens when you change your notes</h1>

        <p>
            After you have made some slides you might want to go back to the edit mode and make some changes
            to your map. In this section we will explain what happens if you move a shape that is on a slide.
        </p>

        <div >
            <h3>Moving a shape inside the slide, or changing styles</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    If you move a shape to a new position that is still on the slide, the slide will simply be updated.
                    The same happens when you change the styling of a shape:
                    Once you switch to the slide menu, the slide previews will be updated to show the new position and style of the
                    shapes on a slide.

                </p>
            </div>



            <h3>Moving a shape outside the slide</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    If you move a shape, but it's new position it no longer inside the slide, the shape will be excluded from the slide. Or put differently: the position of the slide
                    will not be extended to include the shape you moved.
                </p><p>
                    You can however change this in the Update settings menu. If you change the update setting to "always update", the slide will simply be extended to include the shape you moved.
                    If you use the "always ask" setting, a pop up will appear which will give you the choice to either remove the shape, or extend the slide.
                </p>
            </div>
